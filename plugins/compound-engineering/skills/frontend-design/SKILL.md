# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Analysis

1. Identify purpose and audience
2. Note technical constraints (framework, performance, accessibility)
3. Choose ONE bold aesthetic direction from the list below

### Phase 2: Design Commitment

Choose a clear conceptual direction:

| Direction | Character | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Brutally minimal | Sparse, purposeful restraint | Portfolios, luxury brands |
| Maximalist chaos | Dense, layered, energetic | Creative agencies, events |
| Retro-futuristic | Nostalgic tech meets modern | Tech products, gaming |
| Editorial/magazine | Typography-forward, grid-based | Publications, blogs |
| Brutalist/raw | Honest, structural, bold | Art, architecture |
| Soft/pastel | Gentle, approachable, warm | Wellness, children |

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue)
2. Ensure production-grade functionality
3. Execute aesthetic with precision
4. Validate against checklist below

## Aesthetic Directions

### Typography
- Choose distinctive display fonts (avoid Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts)
- Pair display font with refined body font
- Use unexpected, characterful choices

### Color & Theme
- Commit to cohesive aesthetic with CSS variables
- Use dominant colors with sharp accents
- Avoid timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion
- CSS-only solutions for HTML; Motion library for React
- Focus on high-impact moments (page load, staggered reveals)
- Scroll-triggering and surprising hover states

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap
- Diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Visual Details
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Custom cursors, grain overlays

## Anti-Patterns

**NEVER use these generic AI aesthetics:**

- Overused fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk, system fonts
- Cliché schemes: purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Predictable layouts: cookie-cutter component patterns
- Context-free design: lacks specific character for the project

**Key rule:** No two designs should look the same. Vary themes, fonts, aesthetics.

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering:

- [ ] Bold aesthetic direction chosen and executed
- [ ] Typography is distinctive (not generic system fonts)
- [ ] Color palette is cohesive with CSS variables
- [ ] Motion adds delight without distraction
- [ ] Layout has intentional spatial composition
- [ ] Production-grade and functional
- [ ] Matches implementation complexity to vision
